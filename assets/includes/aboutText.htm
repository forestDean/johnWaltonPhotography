        <p>This website is a showcase of John Walton's personal work, giving the viewer both a place to enjoy his perspective &amp; the opportunity to purchase prints.</p>
        <p>The image collections reveal the beauty of the urban margins of east London where the city &amp; country collide. Whether social or landscape subject, the dynamic conflict between conservation &amp; construction forms fleeting moments of wonder in a fragile world.</p>
        <p>We hope you enjoy the pictures.</p>
