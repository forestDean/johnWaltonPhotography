# johnwalton.photography.php
A legacy portfolio website for personal images by **John Walton**, built with PHP and jQuery.    


- **PHP** serves pages to the browser & manages the functionality of slideshow carousels.        
- **jQuery Carousels** render the images to the page.     
- **jQuery LazyLoaders** render image thumbnails.
- **ImageProcessor PHP** resize, label and sort the images
<!-- - **Note:** the Contact Form and Social Icons have been disabled for the demonstration site.  <br><br>     -->

## RoadMap
- refactor this website as a React App
- refactor Image Processor PHP as Node/React App
- integrate Image Processor Node/React App with Adobe Lightroom
- refactor Image Processor Node/React App to generate WebP images
- refactor React App with NextJS and WebP images
